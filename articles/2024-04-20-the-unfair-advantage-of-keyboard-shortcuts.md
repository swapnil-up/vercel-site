The unfair advantage of keyboard shortcuts 

A keyboard press takes 300ms. A mouse movement from one position to another then the press takes about 3 seconds. This is the biggest reasons why we should all learn more keyboard shortcuts. Since we’re all going to be using keyboards and mouses for another 30-40 years, these micro losses of time adds up over time. These results in a loss. Of course there’s the argument that it wouldn’t have mattered anyway, the average user wouldn’t be typing that often either. The delays don’t really matter. Read on. 

Flow is a key ingredient in any creative endeavor. This is proven via numerous studies. One key ingredient that is necessary to achieve this is when you are in a state of complete mind body synergy. When the words flow out from your brain straight onto your paper. Little micro interruptions will have us breaking this flow, which never lets us truly stay in the state. You can’t enjoy a walk when you’re having to calculate how to put one foot in front of the other. At least not in the sense that you’ll freely be able to use the time to work on problems via dis-associative thinking. This is a big problem even if the above efficiency problem doesn’t exist.

Keyboard shortcuts are a virtuous cycle. The first app that you learn shortcuts for will take a bit of time, as there’s a bit of a learning curve to remember a large variety. But as you move to another application a lot of those shortcuts carry over. The ctrl+t for a new tab, and ctrl+n for a new file. The ctrl+s for saving and on it goes. There’s also the ability to modify shortcuts when some don’t align with the ones you are already adept at. This means that especially with apps that are part of the same suite like Microsoft Office, or range of OSS like the suckless project. 

Macros do the above but on a whole new plane. A macro is simply a series of steps that the computer automatically does when the trigger sequence is pressed. For example with cleaning data where you need a specific sequence to delete. 

This leads further into the deep end. As you learn shortcuts it is easier to resonate with quicker software such as the command line or a windows tiling manager. The ability to use software made with the express intent of working to deliver results quickly. Every coder has at least heard of Vim and most of the users swear by it productivity wise. With all of these apps, the key component is a further use of shortcuts to really elevate the workflow into a highly productive retreat. By engaging in the habit of opting for the keyboard more, it’ll allow for introduction of these tool-chains without a large barrier for entry.

In conclusion, this all does come down to you. You could just use your mouse and avoid having to learn more. But it’s absurd to someone from the other side. Like a touch typist looking at someone who’s typing each letter by clicking the corresponding button with a mouse on a virtual keyboard. It’s not for everyone, but the you in a few years just might thank you for it.
