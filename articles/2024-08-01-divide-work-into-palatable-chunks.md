Divide work into palatable chunks



We’ve heard of, ‘just keep putting one foot in front of the other and you’ll be surprised by how far you’ve come.’ Or more likely the modern version of this, ‘I just opened this one reel and the next thing I know I already spent an hour there.’ It’s amazing how easily we understand this, but then won’t think of leveraging this into our more noble pursuits. Imagine saying this line for meditation or studying. We’d think of people who say that as either showoffs or geniuses. Well I can probably make you the first if you give the idea in this article an honest try.


We assume that we can only do all or nothing. To do all the dishes or do it later. To do all the questions on the problem set or none at all. To marathon on day one instead of just getting off the couch. But wait, with stuff we ‘fall’ into it’s divided into chunks for us. No one decides to binge all of Hunger Games, or 12 hours of the extended cut of LOTR. We just believe we’ll watch one more, and another until, surprisingly it’s two in the morning and you’ve finished the twenty hour YouTube marathon. But is there really any difference between these two types of activities? Not really. Anything can be made into a palatable chunk. You could’ve done only two dishes and moved on with your day. You could’ve done one problem and gone to go do another dish or two. But we don’t. A need for completion of what we’ve started when it comes to things that aren’t already neatly packaged into palatable chunks is what’s ruining us. 


We’re raging perfectionists. An attitude of all or nothing guides us along. The lies of saying, “Clear talked about only doing 5 pushups, that’s what I’ll do,” while actually believing you’ll do more after the five. All of it makes us not want to do it in the end. A false palatable chunk. Like lying to a clever kid saying, ‘you just need to eat this one bite,’ but then saying that with every subsequent bite. They all wizen up eventually. This false rhetoric to the self is yet another reason why you don’t actually have palatable chunks for things you actually want to do. If you want this concept to work as easy as going through YouTube shorts you need to get rid of the sneaky falsities you’re trying to slide in.


A palatable chunk is easy to digest. It should be so easy you could do it half asleep, or while you’re hungover. This is the foundation of being able to breeze through it: actually making it a breeze. We could all do a minute of meditation. Two minutes of folding clothes. Three minutes of cleaning our room. That’s how easy it should be. An atomic action with a clear stopping point. By making it so easy to digest you don’t set yourself up for evasive procrastination by dreading doing the thing, and then proceeding to wallow in your dread. But then what, why’d I want to stop then?


The ability to just walk away is crucial. Once that time is up you need to have full autonomy of what you do next. You could choose to do another appetizing portion, but you need the choice. You can’t make it an MLM scheme where you’re strung along with hidden clauses. Your brain may want you to stay for a while longer. But if it doesn’t, it’s better to just walk away. It’s like how Hemingway said, “When you are going good, stop.” That stopping is what will make you want to come back for more. We prefer a clear stopping point, but stopping in the middle of a word that’s in the middle of a sentence that’s in the middle of an essay that’s in the middle of a session you’re enjoying will drive you nuts. You’ll beg to be coming back. This is a part of the secret sauce that’ll keep you coming back: the cliff hanger of a good ending. 


A palatable chunk is by definition appetizing. Having had one you wish to have another, like a cookie after another. And that’s when you reach the true magic. Each chunk gives you a hit of happiness or more likely fulfillment, which makes you want to do it more, and the tension of having stopped while it was going good combines together to start a virtuous cycle in your favor. Feedback loops of short form content use exactly this very strategy. They replace the fulfillment with pleasure which is why it is nowhere as satisfying in hindsight but the feeling of, ‘so easy I just did another’ is still there. TV series constantly leave setups through the story that have us waiting for that oh so sweet payoff. Leveraging these is our goal. 


The palatable chunk is easy to fall into. Once you set it up and see the benefit you should just be able to drop into it whenever. To do a pushup and move on with your day. The pushup shouldn’t be anywhere near hard for you. Anchor it to an activity, like every time you walk into a room and soon you’ll be hitting 20 sets. At 5 pushups each time you’d be doing a 100 everyday, with each ‘set’ being barely an inconvenience. By virtue of being appetizing you can even chain them one after another into a binge session if you feel like it. The first dragging you into the second, then the third until an hour has gone by almost like magic. This idea goes on steroids when you make a palatable chunk so trivial that between that and replying to ‘one’ (it’s never only one) message you’d actually choose the chunk. Imagine that, the idea that learning an anki card or two being preferred over a quick text or look through your feed. That’s why you need to chase satisfaction, it’ll almost always beat cheap pleasure.


Games are an excellent analogy. Think of it as a one off videogame like Asteroids or Tetris. Each run through is what would be a palatable chunk. And it’s pretty easy to play a new game and try to win, or last longer. We know of a lot of mini-games that are used in real life too. Tiger Woods used to play by shooting golf balls into the laundry basket. Joe Simpson crawled back to camp after falling down a mountain’s crevasse by playing a game of seeing if he could reach that next spot within an allotted time. We can replicate this too by dividing our tasks into palatable chunks that we keep playing like games. 


Our attention span is fucked. Ain’t no way we’re doing 25 or 50 minute pomodoros for every aspect of our life and feeling joy throughout it all. There’s a reason why all of content has only been becoming shorter. We’ve been training our minds to prefer shorter tasks with instant gratification. By pitting what’s already been trained into our very deep mental grooves with a new pattern that won’t be likelier to be chosen we’ve set ourselves up for failure. So it is better to jury-rig the groove to default to doing virtuous activities for those same bursts. Then to eventually train ourselves to string along these bursts. It’s empowering to be able to fall into something you find fulfilling but dread doing simply by making the process appealing to your brain. But that can’t be done when you’re trying to fix everything, from your attention span to your habit of defaulting to the cheap pleasures, all at once. 


There were a few ideas sprinkled here, along with systems like Timeboxing that I’ll discuss some other day that make this easier to wrap your head around. But honestly the only thing that’ll make you get this is actually going out and trying appealing portions of work at a time. Go do just a few dishes, and walk away. Let yourself feel the satisfaction of having started and the itch of wanting to do the rest. Relish in that feeling of feeling both the pleasure and the pain, you kinky reader. You know you’ll come to like it ;). A few tries later, add another chunk to the chain. Until someday you can showoff how you meditated for two hours without even realizing.
