I am utterly in love. Truly, entirely. What's caused this is finally getting onto kanata for keyboard shortcuts. The idea stemmed from finally really wanting homerow mods as I start learning Vim. Both of them together is so great. And homerow mods by themselves are so good.

First the pain of not having my usual shortcuts was so great. Not having esc on my right ctrl, the swap of meta and alt on the left, and more. Especially the constantly using the left capslock as my ctrl/ esc key. It was so confusing to navigate.

Now, with my home row mods in place I've been spamming the shift and ctrl so much when I need it, it's insane. I love the feeling of my hands not leaving the home row at all. There's some patterns to break, a slight delay to remember to use the homerow for those keys. 

I also have alt and meta on there, I think. I didn't pay too much attention and those feel functionally useless at the moment. Which leads to the point of this document. I was thinking of what other changes I'd like to make and why, to slowly iterate onto that. 

1. Now that I've got the home row mods all setup, I wish to not move my right hand all the way out for the backspace key. I'm thinking of a better position for that. Maybe one of the alt. 
2. The enter is another one. Since I use space anyway for separating words, why not have shift space lead to an enter being pressed. This would add in more empty to the less frequently used thumbs currently. 
3. I want to play around with layers in the future. The first is one for a symbols/ number layer. A lot that I've seen have it in a second layer, and I've become a fan of that. 
4. I'd also like one for navigation. The up down left right for hjkl probably and stuff like the page up, page down and so on.
