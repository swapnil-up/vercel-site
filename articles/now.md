Written 19th Semptember 2025.

Been working at Mavorion Systems for a year and it's been a journey in Laravel, Vue, Git and more. I love how far I've come but feel like there's so much more to do. Part of the problem I believe stems from how I've come to work with AI at the office, so in a way I have writer's blank page syndrome. I'm fast at coding and understanding how the blocks need to fit, but at the same time I feel like there's a fundamental level that's missing. I'm not sure if it's speed, fluency or something else entirely. To combat this, I've thought and planned on different routes to explore from Anki, to free coding, to following a roadmap and coding, but I'm not sure what is best, there's a journey of exploration in my future regarding this.

I've been quiet outside of work, I enjoy doing anki and learning various pools of knowledge, and I'll find different ways to trick myself into working out, which is always a lovely affair. I think I've started to ponder on what my philosophy is. As a 25 year old, I feel like I'm a little lost regarding what it is that brings me meaning in a holistic sense. Yes, job, money, status, friends, good habits. But to what higher purpose?
