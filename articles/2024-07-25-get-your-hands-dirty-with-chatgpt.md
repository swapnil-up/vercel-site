Get your hands dirty with chatgpt

“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulder of giants,” wrote Isaac Newton long ago. With the rise of ChatGPT, we’ve heard heralds talk about the loss of the job market, and people skiving work by passing it off to these LLMs. But here I’d like to propose an alternate idea that many have not implemented. The use of ChatGPT as an skilled assistant, while you supervise, stumble and learn along the way. 

A skill that you keep working on gets easier over time. You can tolerate more variables as each becomes known to you. Like when driving a car, the newbie will be scared shitless driving on the road for the first time. Measure the distance from the cars to the left, right and front. Keep the speed at a constant. Be ready for jaywalkers and people who don’t turn on their turn signals. Don’t stall the car while changing gears. All of these are cheap cognitively for the experienced driver as a lot of it is processed in the background. What if we could short circuit this process for ourselves. To have a second brain that’ll manage variables and do the processing for us?

A worker’s job description is never just one thing. He has to maneuver his way around multiple responsibilities. Indeed as you progress through the ranks of the corporate ladder, the need to be an ‘all-rounder’ is ever greater. But the friction towards starting to learn a new tool is chafing. As we work on learning a secondary skill that’s not necessary but nice to have, say scripting, the traditional method is one where only the passionate or the desperate will follow through to be adept at. The rest will waffle at the sheer magnitude of variables that they don’t know how to address and give up much too early. 

By using ChatGPT we’re able to painlessly dip our finger into the cookie jar. To create something satisfying that should’ve been out of reach. You can quickly start learning a skill in parts and get a lay of the land so to speak. Focus on one part, while ChatGPT builds the rest. Repeat this over multiple builds and you can see what all is the common jargon and boilerplate to know, and what idiosyncrasies that skill has. This allows you to take your newfound comprehensive abilities to then, look at and appreciate others who are skilled at the work. To look through GitHub repos, and then consume even more works that are actually meaningful. The ability to start walking quickly without months of having to crawl first. 

With the use of ChatGPT we’re able to get instant gratification. We’re able to build things a magnitude greater than what our skills would otherwise allow. To build small things that are immediately usable to solve real life problems. Even more impressive is the use of what is usually industry standard code. No need to worry about the line indents, commas and other trivial code. This gratification of getting to wear the big boy pants translates to a positive feedback loop. You get hooked into the thing you’re learning and start building more and becoming more ambitious. 

Learning in reverse becomes more fun. As a result of having built something that feels meaningful, instead of yet another soulless tutorial project that everyone else builds, you are more likely to feel an investment in the learning because you can see the potential. Now reverse engineering becomes a contextual puzzle. You already made it work, you just need to figure out how. Like all those appliances you opened, or devices you jailbreaked back when you were a kid. You know what steps you took and why, but the guts you need to understand next. Of course, if you stumble you’ve got the documentation to look at, or just ask chatGPT about that too. 

The sandcastle has already been built. Now, you need to understand how it stands strong, so that you can do it again but bigger and better. But like any civil engineer will tell you, the foundation is the most important. You can’t endlessly pile sand and expect the castle to stand tall and stable. Yes, you built the project with chatGPT, but you don’t understand most of it. As we move through the ranks and work on larger, more complex projects if we don’t have the ability to understand anything that’s written then our castle can’t expand without the risk of collapse. You’ll tell it to try a solution, it’ll make an irrelevant change, you’ll tell it to make the change again and a fruitless cycle ensues. You can’t make ChatGPT your only source of expertise, it can only be your worker. 

ChatGPT allows for you to create things beyond your fledgling skills. As a result you’re able to intimately feel the potential that the skill offers. You’re able to peek much further into the horizon as a result of having stood on the shoulder of ChatGPT. You get to play around like a kid, making whatever you want to, and learn through experimentation. That’s the true power for us newbs. But ChatGPT isn’t a shortcut, you still have to learn it all yourself to be able to see that horizon standing on your own two feet. The giant is only a way for you to visualize the potential you have yet to actualize.
