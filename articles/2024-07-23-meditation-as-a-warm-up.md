Meditation as a warm-up


The American President Lincoln when asked how he’d go about the task of felling a tree in 15 hours, said, “I’d spend 14 of them sharpening my blade.” It has been observed that with the rise of TikTok there has been a sharp degeneration in the Pre Frontal Cortex (PFC), which is the part of our brain that makes us not give in to the desires of our lizard brain. What is a way to actively increase the PFC? Meditation. Through this article I’d like to establish a case for why meditation is the equivalent of a warmup for your brain before you get into a cognitively demanding activity like learning. 

Open Instagram, refresh Twitter feed, load 3 different YouTube videos, look through Facebook notifications. Repeat. That is the cycle of the average worker when they’re procrastinating on the internet. We are constantly flitting between these different algorithmic gods, hoping that, this next time is when they’ll reward us with something we find mildly amusing or interesting. 

This constant flitting of attention carries over to when we wish to actually sit down and work for a few hours. Given that the brain always succumbs to the easier of multiple approaches and that dopamine arrives without context, of course we’re tricked into having ‘just one quick look’ at our twitter feed 5 minutes into the work session. That’s the more ‘stimulating’ option. 

We do not have moments of silence, where we just do nothing. All of our thoughts regarding all the content we have consumed is in the background of our brain waiting to be processed. That’s like trying to work on a resource intensive task when your RAM is clogged up with bloatware. You’re not going to be able to get anything done in a reasonable period of time. 

Athletes always warm up before getting into a bout of activity. This is done to get the blood rushing, and the muscles loose and limber. It also allows the athlete to get into the correct headspace. To disassociate from the troubles of the day and hone in their focus onto the task at hand. Even for the regular joe, a warmup is always recommended before you do any type of lifting. To allow the body to work up to 100% and get in the zone in a safe way instead of just rushing into it. 

Meditation allows us a respite from the troubles of the day. Our life is filled with superstimuli. Our days passed in a haze, recovering from what we threw at it before. In eastern martial arts, we’ve seen the artists having to meditate before they swing their sword or perform the kata. To remove the kinks that have crept in throughout the day. The arguments with a partner, the deluge of information floating in the crevices of your mind. By meditating, we give our brain the chance to get rid of all this baggage at least for the time being. 

We’re frustrated by all the distracting thoughts that we have while we’re getting down to do work. The errand, the idea, the need to check for an update. It’s all bloatware that’s clogging up the system. By first allowing a bout of meditation, you’re letting the shitty tap run out all the scummy water. Sometimes you’ll just need to wait a few minutes to let it all out, on others it may take a while. You might even have the scummy water come out in between bouts of clean water. But by meditating you give yourself the opportunity to at least reduce the bloat. 

We’ve made giving in to impulses our default state. When we say we’re distracted by all the junk websites on the internet, in reality it’s our brain that’s become ready to give in to the distraction. While meditating, all we do is focus on the breath and nothing else. There’s an itch that starts creeping around, a train of thought you wish to explore immediately, but the goal is to keep focus on the breath. If we’ve drifted away, then to simply bring our attention back to it. This is literally just practice for all the temptations that arise when you’re connected to the internet. To feel the urge to open Twitter, then to simply bring your attention back to the task at hand. 

Better to spend some time sharpening the axe before you start felling the tree. If we believe we’re average mentally, then why would we not improve our chances at playing with ease and focus by warming up first. It is not a sign of weakness, just a tactic to overcome some of the baggage that modern life provides. By meditating we’re able to practice staying focused at the task at hand, while learning to bob and weave past the distractions. A sandbox to play and practice building sandcastles before moving to concrete things in reality.
