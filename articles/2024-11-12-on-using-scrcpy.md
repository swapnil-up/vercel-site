Don't look down, you tech-neck mouth breather. We're all already suffering from bad posture while working on our desks all day. I present to you scrcpy.

scrcpy give you the screen mirroring. While working on our apps, us mobile developers suffer from the problem of having to make a trade-off between bending over to look at our phone or use an emulator that our 4 GBs of RAM can barely handle half the time. Those damn web developers get to split the screen in half and check everything in real time. Well no more I say. scrcpy brings in an interesting middle ground that I've come to enjoy these last few weeks. Because you're able to mirror your screen while designing the UI, you get to see the changes made in real time. No more bad posture. No more binging on your phone when you get the chance because we just have to check up on something while testing your app. Now you get to binge consciously and feel guilty throughout. 

scrcpy allows you to type with all 10 fingers while you fill out yet another damn form. scrcpy allows for you to use your mouse and keyboard as usual. This allows testing to go by so much faster. Stuff like using ctrl + alt + arrows to move through the screen and never take your hand off the keyboard.

There's a thousand guides to set it up, and there's a lot of different uses for it too. Look it up and go try it out. Once you're done every other time only takes like 5 seconds to load. You could literally load and get it ready in the time your editor is loading everything about your project. Connect your phone via USB or wifi, enter scrcpy into your terminal, move the mirrored screen to sit besides your code editor.
