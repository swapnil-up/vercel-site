I’ve been using greyscale almost full time on my phone these days and keep it on, on my laptop it’s more of a miss at the moment. Mostly because I haven’t made it automatic (changed since I started writing this article). I just realized that these days I don’t even remember if the greyscale is even on. That’s a pretty good achievement and here I’d like to explain why you should at least give greyscale a try.

Our attention span is fucked. Social media has been vying for our attention. One key thing that is used to do this is color. Think about it, all major restaurant brands have the color red. All of the notification bubbles that have the color red too. The edits done to highlight the color and animations when you do certain actions. ‘What is the problem with this?’ you may ask.

Are you enjoying the content or the color behind it? If your attention is directed into a piece of content only because of the way that it is displayed then were you there for the content, or there because you followed the colors like a cat chasing a laser beam. This could explain why we sometimes go on twenty minutes doom scrolls and come out wondering what I did the last twenty minutes.

Grayscale can train our attention spans. Grayscale allows you to remove all color, and change it into tones of black and white which greatly reduces the depth of colors. This makes the screen very boring to look at. Why? Because of the virtue that all pages are optimized for color, it appears much less appealing when in grayscale. This makes us try harder to read content on the screen, instead of getting our enjoyment from the colors on it. Of course this might be different for artists, but for me, either I read the damn content on the page, or I don’t and realize that I didn’t want to anyway. There’s less distractions on there to move my attention.

Grayscale allows you to stop scrolling media mindlessly. Open up your app with grayscale and mindlessly binge your feed. You’ll realize that a lot of the satisfaction of the habit is gone. Taking a page from Clear’s book one of the things that makes you repeat a habit is the satisfaction you feel when you do it. Since this is reduced during the whole process you’re able to detach and make the habit less likely. 

With that we reach the end of this one. Give grayscale a try. It’s usually better to say fuck it and not turn it off when you need to look at a picture.
