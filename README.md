## What is this?

This is yet another experiment blog of mine. This iteration is a VILT stack (vue, laravel, inertia, tailwind) that is working with Vercel to load everything. Yes there's the whole mystery of how I'm running a server based PHP project with serverless hosting in Vercel. It's also pretty cool how I can take all of my data from the github repo via github's api.
