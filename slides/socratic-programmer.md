# The Socratic Programmer

Stop answering.

Start questioning.

---

## When You Face a Problem

Before coding, ask:

- What is the actual constraint?
- What is variable?
- What is invariant?
- What must be true?

---

## Modeling > Memorizing

If you rely on tricks,
you are fragile.

If you understand structure,
you are adaptable.

---

## When You’re Stuck

Don’t Google immediately.

Ask:

What is the simplest version?
What state am I tracking?
What assumptions am I making?

---

## The Real Edge

Better syntax doesn’t win.

Clear thinking wins.

# End

Question deeper than others.
